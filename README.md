# Proof of Concept project: Craft Inventory

An experiment to creating an easy to use modular database framework for general,
mainly personal home inventory keeping.

It is somewhat inspired by Minecraft as a moddable open world platform in which
one gets access to new features built upon the core features via installing
mods. The base entities of this database framework are:

* users,
* worlds (collections),
* types of items,
* queries (filters), mutations and permissions,
* forms and views.

Mods (plugins) are the way to extend the built-in instances of the base classes
of the above list by custom items. A world is an isolated entity that can have
items and mods in it.

In this early stage of this trial I'm coding and trying ideas to see how they
fit while getting practice with some frameworks I am interested in. It is probably 
one of those projects that do not survive. Let me see where it goes...

Thank you for taking a look!
