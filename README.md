# Mini prototype project: Craft Inventory

The personal database framework server you always missed but could not describe.
It has one goal: allowing you to easily model any kind of inventory relations saving
you from writing the usual boilerplate most personal database projects imply, such as user and session handling, permission system, etc.

At this very moment not even I can describe it. Though maybe I will be able through this
prototype. Let this be an experiment.

This is by Minecraft as a moddable open world platform. In this database framework you have:

* users,
* worlds,
* types of items,
* queries, mutations and permissions,
* forms and views.

Mods or extensions or modules or expansion packs - I will probably call them mods - will contain new kinds of items, queries, mutations, permissions, forms, and views. A world is an isolated entity that can have items and mods in it.

Users exist in globally in the framework.

Give me some time to elaborate further :)
